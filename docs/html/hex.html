        <p class="convo">Hello World! <br>It is time for another piece of the puzzle that is color theory and colors on the web. Today, I am going to talk about hex color codes. You may have seen them being used in different color palettes or in code on the web. You may have even used them in your own designs or design software. However, I think it is important to understand the tools we are using, especially when it comes to the web and design. So let's dive right in and learn about how hex color codes work.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="item" id="item3">
        <p class="convo">If you have spent any time looking at code, or even within your design software you may have seen a hex color code. It is a set of six numbers or letters that represent one color on the RGB color spectrum. RGB if you remember, stands for Red, Green, Blue, and it is another system we use to define colors on the web. If you want to learn a little more about that before continuing to learn about hex codes, you can read my previous blog <a href="../html/rgb.html" target="_blank">here.</a> Be sure to come on back after reading to continue learning more about colors on the web!
        </p>
        <p class="convo">When you are looking at your design software, you have three color sliders- one for red, one for green, and one for blue. When you move one of the sliders to change the color you will see a corresponding set of two numbers or letters next to it. There will be a set of two digits for each color- Red, Green, and Blue. When you put them all together you will get the six digits that are the final hex code for that color. They start with the pound sign and look like these codes in the images below. Each one of those hex codes represents the color of the shape they are in.</p>

      <div class="item" id="item4"><p class="convo">Now, let's break down how these codes really work. I am going to use just one color from the RGB model as an example to keep it simple. I am going to use green because that is my favorite color! For this counting example, assume the other colors, red and blue, are set to black or at 00. For hex color codes, the sets of numbers range from 00 through FF. It is the same amount of colors as the RGB model, but the RGB system has colors range from 0 through 255. In hex codes, the numbers 0-9 are used for counting the single digits. The letters A-F, are used for counting the double digits. The letters are used when we get to double digits to keep the hex color code at six digits.</p>
        <p class="convo">Let's look at an example of green moving up in the spectrum from black. Think of it like sliding your color slider in your software one color step at a time. To start out, black is at 00. From there it goes up like this: 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 0A, 0B, 0C, 0D, 0E, 0F. Okay, let's stop and take a look at the color code now. In the hex code, the full color now looks like this: #000F00. If you were to put that in the RGB model it would look like this: RGB(0, 15, 0). I want to count one more set of numbers just so we can really see how the scale changes. The next set counts up like this: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 1E, 1F. In the hex code our color now looks like this: #001F00. In the RGB model the color would look like this: RGB(0, 31, 0). Since we are moving just one step at a time the color may look like it is changing pretty slowly, but it is indeed moving up the color spectrum. If you want to see this in action, I suggest opening up your design software and pick one slider to start changing the hex code- you can see the color changing! If you don't have a design software to use, you can easily search for a color picker on the web- then do the same thing and watch the magic happen!</p>

Even if you aren't coding, now you know a little more about your design software. If you have any questions or just want to learn more, follow me on instagram for updates! "@iamannaofthetrees". Thank you for stopping by and I will talk with you all next time!</p>
