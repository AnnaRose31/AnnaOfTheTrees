        <p class="convo">Hello World! <br>Today I want to dive a little more into the world of color theory. In my previous blog post, I talked about how to create a color palette using a photograph, which really just brushed the surface of color theory. Today I am going to teach you a little more about the topic. More specifically, I am going to talk about the term RGB- what it means and how it works.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="item" id="item3">
        <p class="convo">Especially in the design space, the term RGB is used quite often. As an example, I have been posting some color palettes to my Instagram. When creating them, I have been using the RGB sliders in my design software. You can easily just slide the colors around till you like the way the color looks, but I think it is important to really understand why the tools work the way they do.
        </p>
        <p class="convo">So let's start with the basics. RGB stands for Red, Green, Blue. RGB is an additive color model. This means that when you take all three colors and add them together you get white. When all the colors are absent, you get black. Think of it like shining three lights together against a surface- one red, one green, and one blue. We use the RGB model for a lot of technology, like your computer screen. This is because it is the system your monitor uses to mix light to create the colors you see. Okay, so as you are reading this, look at your monitor or phone screen. Now, all that space is broken down into pixels. Then, those pixels are broken down even further into three sections. Those three sections will emit light in varying amounts of red, green, and blue to create the larger images that you see on your screen. When all those tiny pixels of light are combined, your eye doesn't notice the little dots but instead sees the screen as a whole image. To show you an example of what it means to add these colors together, check out the image below. This image shows what each of the three primary colors (red, green, and blue) look like when they are added or mixed together.</p>

      <div class="item" id="item4"><img src="../images/rgb2.svg"> </div>
      <div class="item" id="item5"><p class="convo">The RGB color model is an 8 bit color system, which allows for 256 colors. This means that each of the three colors scales from 0 to 255. When they are at 0, you will see black, and when they are at 255, you will see white. The image below shows an example of scaling all three colors at the same rate. For example, the first square has red set at 0, green set at 0, and blue set at 0. This creates that full black color. As the numbers go up towards 255, the gray gets lighter and lighter. To create a color other than gray, you can combine or mix each of the colors in varying amounts, instead of scaling them all at the same rate.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="item" id="item2"><img src="../images/rgbBanner2.svg"> </div>
      <div class="item" id="item6"><p class="convo"> Let's look back at the design software with the RGB sliders. When you slide the red to a certain amount, and then the blue to a certain amount, then the green to a certain amount, you can pick a color you like. The software will most likely show somewhere near the sliders a number associated with each one. You will see three numbers. Can you guess what those numbers mean? Yup! Those three numbers represent the amount of intensity of light your device will emit of red, green, and blue. In the technology world we list these colors like this: RGB(0, 144, 0). This reads that there is no red, green is at 144, and no blue. If you put those numbers into an RGB color picker you will see a nice green. The image below is the same mix of colors from before, but I have added the numbers for each section to show you how each color is mixed. As one last example, take a look at the yellow section. It reads that red is set to 255, green is set to 255, and there is no blue. When you put those colors into an RGB color picker, you will see that bright yellow. </p></div>

        <div class="item" id="item8"><p class="convo">Thank you for stopping by and learning a little bit about the RGB color model today! Next time you need to use the tools within your design software to pick out some colors for a design, I hope the things you learned today come to mind.
