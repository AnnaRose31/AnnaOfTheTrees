        <p class="convo">Hello World! <br> It is time for a spring update on Wild Rose Island! We have had a lot of events since the last time we checked in- including Festivale and Bunny Day! The snow has melted and the flowers are blooming, bringing back wonderful memories of last year when the island was brand new. Wild Rose has also undergone some awesome renovations that I want to share with you all today. </p>

        <p class="convo">Before we dig into the renovations on the island, I want to share a little bit about the spring events. Festivale was up first, bringing with it some bright colors and fun to the end of the snowy season. The preparations for Festivale were almost as much fun as the event itself. I loved going to the shop each day and seeing the new items, they really brought some vibrance to the snowy world. And let's be honest, the island Christmas decorations hadn't been fully put away yet, so this was a good time for a little change of seasons cleaning and redecorating. I began to clean and redecorate immediately, and lucky for me my shop items were green- my favorite color! On the day itself I was glad to learn the recipe for the rainbow feather so that I could start customizing my Festivale items to create all kinds of rainbow displays around my island! Everything was so sparkly and colorful!
        </p>
        <p class="convo">My neighbors really enjoyed celebrating Festivale as well and were all dressed up and dancing around the plaza. I spent some time on my island celebrating with my neighbors and Pave, but Mambo and I had big plans to celebrate as well! Mambo had spent a lot of time preparing a big party area over on Polka Dot. Also, lucky for her the decorations she got at the shop before hand were all pink- her favorite color! So, I headed over to Dodo Airlines and took the quick flight over to Polka Dot to celebrate with Mambo. We had a blast! She and her neighbors were all dressed up and ready to dance the day away. I helped Mambo catch the last of the feathers she needed to give Pave, and we spent some time on the dance floor. Mambo had even bought some sparkling champagne for us to cheers with! We had a wonderful time celebrating this rainbow day!</p>

      <div class="item" id="item5"><p class="convo">Next up in the spring events was Bunny Day! Last year I was on my island by the time Bunny Day came around, so I already had a few decorations and eggs stored up to decorate. The new items in the shop really elevated the Bunny Day feel to the island too! I think my favorite is the Bunny Day Tree with those cute little colorful eggs hanging from it. Mambo had not yet traveled to her island at this time last year, so I spent a lot of my egg collecting time helping Mambo with whatever eggs she needed to complete all the cute recipes for the season. When Bunny day came around, I celebrated with my neighbors, who were all in their little outfits ready to eat candy and hunt for eggs! I had to share this amazing photo I took with my neighbor O'Hare- it made me laugh out loud! He is a rabbit and he told me that his favorite thing about Bunny Day is that we all get to be bunnies with him! He is such a good egg as they say (yes, pun intended)!</p>

      <div class="item" id="item6"><p class="convo">Now that we have covered the big spring celebrations, it is time for me to show off these awesome renovations on Wild Rose. In the real world, my family and I took a trip to Walt Disney World which gave me so many inspirations for my island! When I got home, I thought that my neighbors might like a little spring vacation too, so I went to work creating some Disney magic for them. The first thing I wanted to create for them was a mermaid themed area. I was inspired by how immersive the shopping district was in Hollywood Studios- Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge. I wanted to bring some of that feeling to the mermaid shopping district. I created custom flooring for the shop and set out the most beautiful mermaid items one can buy. I also knew that my neighbors would want to rest their feet and have a little tea in the shade after standing in line to see the shops. I created a little mermaid dining spot for them to come and have a snack under the palm trees. The last section that every good theme park area needs is a place to take some themed selfies! I created another custom floor- and of course it needed to be pink! I wanted to make sure that there were ropes set out as well so the selfie display wouldn't get crowded and my neighbors would take turns coming up to take a photo by the beautiful fountain and shells. I want to also give a big shout out to Mambo for helping me get this mermaid park ready! She donated lots of mermaid themed items I did not have so that I could give my mermaid adventure a fully immersive feel.</p>

        <div class="item" id="item7"><p class="convo">The second theme park area I wanted to create on my island was inspired by the Mad Tea Party ride at Disney World. When I initially saw this item for sale for Nook Miles, I bought it and knew I wanted to display it somewhere on my island but wasn't sure what to do with it yet. The remake of the teacup ride though was the perfect place! This area required a lot more construction than the mermaid adventure area. I had to break out the tools and do some terraforming and water scaping to get just the right feel. I wanted it to be elegant and whimsical. I decided to move a few things around so that I could create a waterfall feature to compliment the ride. Just like in the mermaid adventure park, I knew my guests would want a place to sit down, rest their feet, and have a cup of tea or some pastries. And I thought, what better of a place to sit and have a snack than next to a beautiful waterfall? I decided to use some of the Bunny Day items here because the colors went together so well with the ride. I also wanted to use those items because it was a little nod to the rabbit in the book where the Mad Tea Party ride got its original inspiration from- Alice in Wonderland. After having a little snack my neighbors could climb up the incline and get in line for the ride! I added a few little tea-time decorations around the ride as well to bring in some more immersion.</p>

          <div class="item" id="item8"><p class="convo">I hope to expand and create more theme parks down the road on the island, so I will be sure to take lots of pictures when they are done. This was a big spring update, so thanks for hanging out with me and catching up with life on Wild Rose! I hope you all have a magical rest of your day and I will talk with you again soon.
