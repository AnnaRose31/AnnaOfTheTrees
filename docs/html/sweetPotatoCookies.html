        <p class="convo">Hello World! <br>Today I am going to write to you about one of my many loves- cookies. This recipe is a fun and simple twist on the classic chocolate chip pumpkin cookie. This cookie and the pumpkin version are a fall favorite in my home. It is absolutely a bake more than one time in a season kind of recipe, for sure. It is a light and fluffy cookie, almost muffin-like in consistency. If you were feeling inspired to add your own twist to the recipe, you could put the dough into muffin tins and make more of a cookie inspired muffin. However, I prefer cookies over cake/muffins in most cases- so that is what we will dive into today. </p>

         Let me start off by saying that this is my very first blog post. Originally when I decided that I was going to start a blog- most of my ideas I had written down for the future were in the tech world. I have a love for that world as well and I want to contribute to the great exploration that is the universe of tech and web design. However, looking at all those ideas, I didn't know which one to pick first. So just like the warm coziness of a freshly baked cookie, I decided to start with something comfortable. Now, I will tell you that my absolute favorite type of cookies are fresh, gooey chocolate chip cookies. So I could have started with that recipe. At some point I probably will put up the recipe I use for the classic chocolate chip cookie as well, but today I decided on Sweet Potato Chocolate Chip.
        </p>
        <p class="convo">
          I chose this cookie to bring to you for two reasons. The first is that as I am writing this, the leaves are changing colors and the world is relaxing into that bright orange glow before winter arrives. There is a little crisp in the air, but only enough to make you happy to drink cider and wear a cozy sweater. And what goes better with a glass of cider than sweet potato chocolate chip cookies? Turns out not much can beat it! I think my husband looks forward to the changing of seasons because he knows this recipe is coming out of the box again. My husband is not much of a sweets man, but I think he could eat the whole batch of these cookies by himself- Or at least mostly by himself. Of course I have to try a few cookies while I'm baking them - I think that's basically a requirement for baking cookies!
          <p class="convo">The second reason I chose this recipe today, was more out of necessity. I do not want to spend a lot of time on this subject, but the world has been strange lately. In fact, when I went to the store to get ingredients for this bake I wanted to get a new bag of flour. I thought I would have enough left, but I tend to make a mess when i'm baking so I wanted to get another bag just in case I ran out. However, there was no flour on the shelves. So I just told myself I will measure carefully and try not to stir the flour all over the kitchen. This made me worry though, that I might not find the key ingredient I needed for the cookies. You see, when I came into the store I was hoping to bake the aforementioned pumpkin chocolate chip cookies. With ingredients for baking and particularly canned goods disappearing off the shelves in larger quantities I could not find canned pumpkin anywhere. I searched through all the isles that made sense for canned pumpkin, and even a few that didn't, in hopes the store had set them out for us fall bakers. But canned pumpkin was nowhere to be found. As I was double checking the shelves, I was thinking about what I could do instead- and then it dawned on me. Let me try this recipe with sweet potatoes! They are sweet and orange too, they have a similar texture, and they also invoke those same fall flavors as pumpkin. Thankfully the store had plenty of canned sweet potatoes left!</p>
          <p class="convo">So here we are and it's time to bake those cookies! I simply used the recipe I had for the pumpkin cookies and substituted the sweet potatoes in at the same measurements. The sweet potatoes really are about the same texture as the pumpkin so I was guessing nothing else would need to be added or removed to get the cookies to turn out just as good. The experiment worked, and the sweet potato cookies turned out delicious, fluffy, and still a house favorite! <br>Sometimes in life you have to pivot and make the best of what you have or have the ability to get. Just like in life, you have to be flexible when baking too. Sometimes the first batch burns and you have to start over. Sometimes you only have one egg when the recipe calls for two. And sometimes there is a pandemic and there is no canned pumpkin at the grocery store. However, if you embrace it, you can easily do a little pivoting and make things work with what you have. With that my friends, I give you- Sweet Potato Chocolate Chip Cookies! Enjoy! </p>

        <p class="title">Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
        <li class="list">2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li class="list">2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li class="list">1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li class="list">2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li class="list">1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li class="list">1 cup canned sweet potatoes</li>
        <li class="list">1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li class="list">1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li class="list">1 tablespoon vanilla</li>
        <li class="list">1 egg</li>
        <li class="list">2 cups chocolate chips (or to tatse)</li>

        <p class="title">Directions</p>
        <ol>
          <li class="list">Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). I always like to preheat my oven first so it's ready when my cookies are all ready to bake.</li>
          <li class="list">In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. Stir this well till all the ingredients are mixed nicely.</li>
          <li class="list">In a medium bowl, combine the sweet potatoes, sugar, vegetable oil, vanilla, and egg. Sometimes sweet potatoes come in chunks out of the can. If this is the case with yours, mash them up first with a fork till they are closer to a puree before adding any other ingredients. It's okay if there are still some smaller chunks, it will add texture to your cookies. </li>
          <li class="list">Take the sweet potato mixture and pour into the flour mixture. Stir this well till all the ingredients are combined.</li>
          <li class="list">Stir in the chocolate chips. You are welcome to use more or less depending on your taste choices. Just remember, if you add too much, there won't be enough dough to hold the cookies together (even though that chocolatey gooeyness is the best part!)</li>
          <li class="list">Grease your cookie sheet. I like to just take a lump of butter and run it along the surface till it's lightly covered. Scoop out the dough in spoonful sized blobs and place on a cookie sheet. These cookies will spread and rise when baking, but not by a huge amount- so keep that in mind when placing on the cookie sheet.</li>
          <li class="list">Bake cookies at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for approximately 10 minutes or until lightly golden brown and firm. The cookies do continue to bake a little tiny bit when you let them cool on the sheet as well.</li>
          <li class="list">Enjoy! Store in a cookie tin or jar, or on a plate under some tin foil or saran wrap so the cookies stay soft.</li>
        </ol>
