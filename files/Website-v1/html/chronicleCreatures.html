      <div class="item" id="item2"><p class="convo">This is a current project in the works, and a website will be up soon! For now, here is a little bit about the journey of the project and the ideas behind "S'mores World!"
        <p class="convo">The ideas behind the project are a discussion about the human/machine marriage. Technology can be very beneficial and sometimes almost necessary to live our modern lives as humans. Sometimes though, whether it is on the designers end or the way the machine reacts, technology can be a hindrance to getting things done. The question then becomes, how can we design something that brings out the strengths in both the humans and the machines? How do we combine the skills of the artists and the engineers to create something unique and accessible to more people?</p>

      <div class="item" id="item4"><P class="convo">This project started how I think a lot of great ideas do- through conversation. My family and I were sitting around the table having some french toast and tea talking about how technology can be so helpful at times, and others just about the opposite. When designing an app for example, how do you make the UI understandable without needing to provide instructions? What are the things we as modern humans understand as (close to) universal symbols? We talked about the things that made sense to us as users when it came to technology. We also began thinking about where technology can go from here. How can we better engineer our apps so that they learn from their users and become something customized just for the user. Simply put, how do you make your technology feel like that favorite pair of jeans? The ideas have evolved over time with this project, but we have landed on something that begins to explore this human/machine marriage. We are creating a web based story with all responsive elements. This project will demonstrate how technology can work with the user to become more user friendly and reach beyond just another app in your phone. What started as a discussion over brunch really grew and is now a family passion project.</P></div>

    <div class="item" id="item7"><P class="convo">Let me spend a little time talking about the different pieces of technology that we have been using to create this project. This is a web-based project as we feel this will make it more accessible and unique. Being that the project is web-based, this has led us to the decision to use responsive web design and all that comes with it. We have also been working with SVG images, and in case you cannot tell by the rest of my website- I fell in love with SVG images!

    <div class="item" id="item8"><P class="convo">I want to share just a few resources and inspirations we have for this project.
    </P>
    <P class="convo">When it comes to SVG, we found a lot of helpful information from Amelia Bellamy-Royds through the books and articles she has written. <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/6190" target="_blank"
      >Here is a link to her bio and some of her wonderful books.</a>
    </P>
    <P class="convo">One of the original inspirations for this project came from the idea of cellular automata. A famous mathematician named John Conway extended these systems to two dimensions (picture a checkerboard extending out to infinity) and discovered that, with the right set of simple rules, he could, in effect, create a world of little creatures which interacted with each other in strange and surprising ways. This system was called "Conway's Game of Life." <a href="http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-7-cellular-automata/" target="_blank"
      >You can find information about cellular automata and "Conway's Game Of Life" here.</a>
    </P>
    <P class="convo">We also owe creative inspiration to Bret Victor who is  one of the thought leaders in this space. He is passionate about using computers to create new art forms - leveraging their strengths, like simulation and interactivity.
