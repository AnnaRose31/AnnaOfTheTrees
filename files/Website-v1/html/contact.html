        <h1>I Am Anna of The Trees</h1>
        <p>
          I have been an artist my whole life. When I am creating art in my free
          time I usually work in the mediums of photography, printmaking, or pen
          and ink. There is something special that happens when you work with
          your hands and create something. Though, I realised along the way as
          an artist that there is that same feeling when working in the graphic
          arts and in web design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Web design is a form of creating something that can easily be shared.
          It was something I fell in love with as a kid, but took a step away
          from for a while. I am back to it now and love the process of
          tinkering with the code, graphics, and user experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of web design and art, I love to bake, do a little yoga in the
          sunshine, and spend time with my family. I live near the mountains,
          and that's where my soul belongs. Any time I can get away you will
          find me in the mountains hiking or climbing around on the rocks- or as
          my husband and I like to joke, billy-goating around.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am always open to new opportunities and ideas. If you would like to
          create something with me or simply have a question, please reach out.
          I would love to chat.
