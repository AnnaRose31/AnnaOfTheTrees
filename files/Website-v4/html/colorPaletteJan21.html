        <p class="convo">Hello World! <br>I want to talk with you today about how to choose a color palette from a photograph. I realized that for me, coming up with a set of colors that looks good together is almost second nature, but it is not that way for everyone. One good way to find colors that go well together for your art and designs is to work from a photograph you like. For this blog post, I chose a photograph I took as an example for my color palette. I want to walk you through my thought process in finding the right color combination so that you can do the same with your designs.</p>

        <p class="convo">The first thing when you don't have a specific color palette in mind already is to find something that gives you inspiration. For me, that is often a photograph I find appealing to the eye. If it is a nice photo to look at, there must be another reason besides the composition and context of the photo- the colors must be nice too. The photo I chose for today's example is one I took on an early, cold morning when the frost from the night before hadn't been touched by the sun's warm rays yet. It felt almost like a frosty pastel world so I snapped a few photos. When I was looking for something to inspire a color palette for my future designs, this photo came to mind. Now, this is a whole other conversation for another day, but when I take a photograph I try to create it in such a way that there will be minimal editing to produce the final image. So this photo has been edited with just the basics, meaning the colors within have not been too skewed from real life.

        <p class="convo">Like I said earlier, choosing colors that go well together has always been easy for me. I can find one color and know, without thinking too much about it what other colors might look good with it. This is just the way my brain works, plus a little training from art school never hurts! However, I feel like there are people out there who really struggle to see a connection in colors. Just like I struggle at other aspects in web development and design, choosing a color palette is something not everyone is good at. I want to share my thought process in hopes that it will help you choose colors you can use for your next project or work of art. I may be talking about choosing colors mostly in the context of web design today, but you can apply these same thoughts to other digital art or physical art as well.</p>

      <div class="item" id="item5"><p class="convo">When choosing a color palette for your designs, you may need to keep some things in the back of your mind. What are the feelings that you want users to get from this design? Do you want to bring in a feeling of energy? Or calm? Different color combinations do come with different feelings for the user. I feel like that is another conversation as well for a future blog as it plays into the ideas behind color theory. I will be digging into that conversation in future posts because I think it is important when considering the colors for your designs. For the purpose of today though, let's just say you already know what kind of attitude you want your design to have and you have your awesome photograph all picked out.</p>
        <p class="convo">For me, there are two main ways to piece out colors from a photograph. One, you could open your photo in whatever photo editing software you use and select the color picker tool to choose a few sections of the photograph. Or two, you could open up the photo just to view it, and pick out the colors in whatever design software you use more by eye. For this palette I did a little bit of both. I knew I wanted just three or four colors that looked good together to keep my future design simple. Though, if you wanted you could use your photo as inspiration and pick out as many colors as you need for your purpose.</p>

      <div class="item" id="item6"><p class="convo"> First, I opened up my photo in my photo editing software of choice, Affinity Photo, then I used the color picker tool to select the blue in the sky. It is very prominent in the photograph and to me, it still looked as good once in a color sample as it did in the photograph. This was the only color I used exclusively the color picker tool for. For the rest of the colors, I did use the color picker tool but then I edited the color sample with the tools till it looked more like what I was looking for. Next, I knew I wanted a dark, almost black color so I chose a dark spot within the trees. However, the color picker saw that it was more neutral of a color than I wanted. I was looking for something with a little more blue tint to it, so I used the rgb and hsl sliders till it was more what I was looking for. From there, I knew I had to pull in that lovely frosty green from the tips of the trees. Again, I started with the color picker, but it was more of a gray green and I wanted to show off that beautiful color when you pull back and see all those needles in the tree from a distance. I chose to make it a little more green and saturated than what the tool selected. For the fourth color, I wanted to add a little warmth since I had chosen all cool greens and blues so far. I decided to place the color picker tool over the clouds, which to me looked like they had a hint of that beautiful sunrise orange-pink. Of course, the tool saw it was much closer to white than I was looking for and I think this was the color I manipulated the most in the palette with my tools. I wanted more of a pink hue than the tool had found, as well as something a little more noticeable than almost white. My final step after I had chosen the colors was to take the circles I had made and place them on top of the photograph in my design software. There is an example of this below. I would suggest doing this as well with your design colors if you want them to stick to matching the photograph. Doing this will show you how your color choices look with each other and the with the photograph. You can then go back and edit them as needed. </p></div>
