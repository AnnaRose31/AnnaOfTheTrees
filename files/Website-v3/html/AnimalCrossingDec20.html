        <p class="convo">Hello World! <br> With the Holidays coming to a close for the winter I thought I would spend some time telling you about my Animal Crossing Christmas Vacation! I want to touch on the subject of the year- how things have been so different for many people, especially  around the holidays. Everyone has found their own way of dealing with things and I think Animal Crossing really has brought so many friends and families together virtually that would normally be spending the holidays together in person. With the magic of our islands, we are able to spend time together celebrating the holidays. </p>

        <p class="convo">Of course, we have our favorite returning guest today- Mambo! She and I decided to celebrate Christmas day on my island, Wild Rose this year. One of the good things about our islands is that "Toy Day" is actually celebrated on Christmas Eve. This way, I could spend some time celebrating with my neighbors as well before Mambo and I had our big party the next day. I couldn't wait to celebrate! I think the first thing I did after breakfast was hop over to my island to look for Jingle. Jingle comes to town to help out Santa and deliver presents to all the neighbors on the island. When I arrived he was there in the town center ready to help spread some Toy Day cheer to all of Wild Rose! He offered me the job of helping to play Santa, and of course I'm going to say yes to that! Plus, I thought maybe I would get some sweet Christmas cookies out of the deal too.
        </p>
        <p class="convo">This year was much simpler than last year's island Toy Day event. This time around Jingle already had all of the toys ready to go for each neighbor from their lists to Santa. I had no guesswork to do about what each neighbor might be wanting. I put on my Santa outfit and headed out to spread some joy of my own! Of course, I did talk to all my neighbors because they all have been good this year. But I took a few photos along the way to share with everyone. In the evening after the day's activities I headed back to my island to enjoy the soft glow of warm Toy Day lights. When I got up to the section of my island that was all decked out for the holidays, I found Nana and Benedict up there enjoying the lights as well. We all sat down for a little while and took in the beautiful displays. </p>

      <div class="item" id="item5"><p class="convo">So Mambo and I had decided to spend Christmas day on my island for our party because I spent a lot of time prior to the celebration hunting down balloons for recipes and clearing areas to set up the party. One windy night I spent several hours running up and down my beach looking for balloons. I was determined to get a few recipes so I could make us a beautiful Christmas party! I didn't end up collecting them all, but I found enough to create some awesome light displays.</p>
        <p class="convo">I ended up with three different Toy Day/Christmas sections on my island. Yes, I went all out! My first section was what I decided to call my Island of Misfit Toys. Here I had collected all the toys that the Nook brothers had been selling throughout the season. I wanted to set up a little place for my neighbors to come play with the toys. I think it turned out quite cute! I had to take Mambo there as well so we could play together with all the awesome seasonal toys! For the second section of my Island, Mambo and I decided we wanted to recreate a Nativity scene for Christmas. We came up with the idea one night and ran with it! We thought it would look best on the beach so I found a place near my home to set it up. Now, if Animal Crossing would give us mannequins it would have been a little more decorated, but we worked with what we had. We had The Three Wisemen, some animals looking into the manger, we even found items that resembled gold, frankincense, and myrrh! And of course we have The Baby in the manger with a halo. Mambo and I took turns playing Mary and Joseph for a few photos. But we also wanted to have a few photos as sheep too since Mambo had brought over some cute sheep costumes!</p>

      <div class="item" id="item6"><p class="convo">The third section for our Christmas party was the area with the light displays. I am so happy with the way it turned out! I spent some time terraforming the island so my reindeer could be floating on the water. I had most of the area set up, but then Jingle gave me a couple presents to thank me for all my work as Santa (Or as Nana would say, "Pumpkin Claus"). Some of those presents ended up being recipes for some more awesome Toy Day/Christmas items! So I had to do a little rearranging but I wanted to fit all the cool new items in for our party the next day. I knew right away too where that sled had to go- I had the perfect spot already ready behind my reindeer! After Mambo and I played with some toys, and took some photos at the Nativity scene we headed over to the lights display! I had put out some tea and a strawberry yule log Mambo had given me for us to snack on while we enjoyed the lights. After all that celebration we were both getting a little sleepy so we read "The Night Before Christmas" and I think Mambo actually fell asleep on that comfy couch a little! It was a wonderful way to celebrate Christmas! We both want to thank you for spending some time with us today and wish everyone peace and happiness in the new year!</p>
