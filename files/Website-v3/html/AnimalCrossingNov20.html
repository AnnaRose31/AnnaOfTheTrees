        <p class="convo">Hello World! <br>Today I am going to write to you about one of my favorite games to play- Animal Crossing! If you cannot tell from the beautiful graphics, I am playing the Animal Crossing: New Horizons edition. I decided to spend a little time today with you all talking about the fun fall activities, including my favorite Holiday- Halloween!</p>

         Before we get too far along I want to welcome my favorite person to play Animal Crossing with to the stage- my mom! Otherwise known as Mambo! She comes to us today from the Island of Polka Dot and she has brought along some Halloween tricks and of course treats! To give you reference, in the photo above, I am the one with red hair and green horns, and Mambo has brown hair and the orange horns.

          Since I love Halloween, I am sure you can imagine how much time I spent getting my island ready for the Halloween Event in town. I wanted Mambo to come over and help me get all set up for the festivities. I decided to create a section of my Island that would become sort of like a fall carnival area. As you can see in the background I had the popcorn popping for all my visitors. You can't see it in this picture, but there was cotton candy too! Of course, like every good fall carnival there had to be a section to take selfies and family photos! I asked Mambo to come pose with me in the spooky setup.
          <p class="convo">I knew my fall carnival needed to have a section to play some games as well! Because what's a good fall festival without some games to win candy and treats? But here is where things get a little spooky! If you have played this game before, you'll know that you spin the wheel, it goes 'round and 'round for a while and then stops on a number. Of course, Mambo and I wanted to test out a few of the games before the big day so she took a spin. The number landed on 6, no big deal, that's a cool number. Then I took a turn and spun the wheel- it also landed on 6.... Um! Mambo and I were starting to get a little spooked, there was no way, three in a row... it wasn't going to be another 6, right? Well, Mambo took the last spin.... and lo and behold it was another 6! The spookiest of numbers for Halloween, 666! Mambo and I decided it was time to take a break from that game and move on to the snacks. Let's just say, we have both been a little scared to play the game since then.</p>

      <div class="item" id="item5"><p class="convo">I also wanted to share a few photos of my neighbors all dressed up on Halloween. We had a great time giving out treats, and a few spooky tricks. Rosie cracks me up! And look at little O'Hare in his green costume!</p></div>
      <div class="item" id="item6"><p class="convo">After the Halloween event was over Mambo and I started our prep for the Turkey Day/Thanksgiving Event. I think we both decided that we would do a little island decoration prep for it, but were really conserving our energies for the Christmas activities. After I shared Thanksgiving with my neighbors on my island, it was time to head out in real life for a feast. So I came over to Mambo's island a few days later to share some Thanks. Mambo had redone her whole living room to be a peaceful fall forest. First we did a little Thanksgiving yoga to center our minds on all we do have to be thankful for this year. Then, we sat down for a feast at her colorful mushroom table! From Mambo and myself, thanks for spending time with us today!</p>
