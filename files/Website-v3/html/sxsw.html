      <div class="item" id="item2"><p class="convo">For this project, I worked closely with Director, Data Science, Capital One Labs, Michael Edwards (who also happens to be the coolest dad around) and his team. The team was working on technology that will detect banking fraud before it happens. Here is a snippet from their project.</p>
      <p class="convo">"Artificial intelligence aims to improve the scale, performance, or quality of human work. However, the best tools are often a human-machine marriage which leverages the strengths of each. Join us for an interactive session where we'll explore the ways simple choices can lead to complex systems which draw upon user knowledge and improve with use. We'll invite you to create your own masterpieces by iterating on machine-generated seed poems (bring your smart phones!), and we'll discuss the way these techniques can be used to combat fraud, enhance creative work, and empower experts to flourish."</p>

      <div class="item" id="item3"><P class="convo">The team was creating an app that would learn on its own. For the conference they wanted to use a unique and simple example that would be appealing to a large audience.So the crowd created pieces of a poem. At the end of the session, the technology learned from the crowd and created one, beautiful poem with bits and pieces from the whole group.</P>
        <p class="convo">My part in this project was to add an artistic and creative perspective. I wanted to add imagery that would emphasize the tool behind this talk, a tool that will catch fraud before it even happens. Adding imagery to this project helped connect the dots between the poetry being written and the tool behind it.</p>
        <p class="convo">I wanted to add something tangible to the project- something that the guests could hold in their hands and even take home with them. I created an image that represented the idea of detecting fraud and stopping it before it even happens. The looming, hooded figure is shadowed and represents the fraudster. In contrast, the laptop has thriving, growing vines that are climbing out of the screen to catch the fraudster and stop them in their tracks.</p><p class="convo">This was a series of 200 prints. They are 5" x 4" in size and all hand made with block carving, ink, and paper.</p> </div>
